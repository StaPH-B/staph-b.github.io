#### Additional resources

There were many references discussed in this presentation. Most of those references can be found in this [Paperpile library](https://paperpile.com/shared/uSfhgd).

During the ANI-MASH portion, there were several Tableau visualizations. These visualizations are linked in my original ANI-MASH presentation [HERE](http://www.staphb.org/training/bacterial-id/).

Some additonal BLAST links are:
- [NCBI BLAST Site](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)

- [NCBI BLAST Help Pages](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs)

The following videos are an excellent description of the BLAST algorithm presented by Dr. Rob Edwards at SDSU. The videos are highly recommend to the student to get a better understanding of the algorithm, its history, and applications beyond just DNA:DNA pairwise comparions.
