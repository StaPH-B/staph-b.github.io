# StaPH-B Website

This is a repository for the StaPH-B website.

## Credits

This website was modified from the template designed by Andrew Branchich [forty-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme), which is a Jekyll version of the "Forty" theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).

Original README from HTML5 UP:

This is Forty, my latest and greatest addition to HTML5 UP and, per its incredibly
creative name, my 40th (woohoo)! It's built around a grid of "image tiles" that are
set up to smoothly transition to secondary landing pages (for which a separate page
template is provided), and includes a number of neat effects (check out the menu!),
extra features, and all the usual stuff you'd expect. Hope you dig it!
