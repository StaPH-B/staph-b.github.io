### About

The State Public Health Bioinformatics Group (StaPH-B) is a consortium of public health scientists interested in addressing the common barriers impeding bioinformatics implementation in state public health laboratories. Our efforts are focused in the following areas:

- Building and sustaining an appropriate bioinformatics infrastructure within regional state PHLs
- Training public health scientists on the fundamentals of bioinformatics
- Development of bioinformatics applications, tools and pipelines
- Facilitation of CLIA approval for Bioinformatics applications, tools and pipelines
- Partner with the CDC and APHL to ensure compatibility and utility of our efforts.

StaPH-B members possess a wide range bioinformatics experience, from molecular biologists gaining familiarity with NGS and web-based applications, to experienced practitioners with advanced degrees in the field capable of scripting custom tools. This diversity of experience allows StaPH-B to approach problems from a multitude of perspectives and develop high-efficacy solutions that are both technically sound, and practical to public health investigations.

### Current Projects
- Building templates for various solutions regarding state informatics infrastructure
 - e.g. security documents for Linux OS, University Affiliations, etc.
 - Cloud computing
  - StaPH-B Google/AWS VM with preloaded bioinformatics applications
- Defining communication standards between Bioinformatics specialists and Epidemiologists
- Development and validation of bioinformatics tools for various applications:
 - NGS quality assessment
  - In silico â€‹ taxonomic identification, serotyping, virulence determination, and antimicrobial resistance from NGS data
 - Reference-based cluster analysis (hqSNP)
 - Reference-free cluster analysis (pan genome based clustering)
