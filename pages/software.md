## Welcome to the Software Page!

Bioinformatics software can be open source or commercial, and even commercial vendors can provide open source software for their instrumentation.

### Open Source Software

[StaPH-B Github Repository](https://github.com/StaPH-B) - scripts, pipelines, and guides for bioinformatics analysis.  Linux and MacOS focused.

[StaPH-B DockerHub Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/) - Docker images for bioinformatics analysis maintained by StaPH-B members.  A guide to this resource can be found [HERE](https://staph-b.github.io/docker-builds/).

[Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/index.html) - Bioconda is a channel for the conda package manager specializing in bioinformatics software.

[Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) - A free-to-use wrapper of many bioinformatics tools, with a graphical interface, moderate storage and computational resources, and easy standardization of workflows for reuse.

### Open Source Tools for Illumina Sequencers

[BaseMount](https://basemount.basespace.illumina.com/) - BaseMount allows you to explore through runs, projects, samples, app results and analyses and interact directly with the associated files exactly as you would with any other file system. For MacOS and Linux.

[BaseSpace Sequence Hub CLI](https://developer.basespace.illumina.com/docs/content/documentation/cli/cli-overview) - The BaseSpace Sequence Hub CLI supports scripting and programmatic access to BaseSpace Sequence Hub for automation, bulk operations, and other routine functions. It can be used independently or in conjunction with BaseMount.  For Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

[BaseSpace API](https://developer.basespace.illumina.com/docs/content/documentation/rest-api/api-reference) - REST API for run data.
