## Welcome to the Quality Page

This page will serve as the starting point for all resources related to quality that may be of interest to public health scientists working in bioinformatics and NGS.  Currently, our main emphasis is for infectious disease applications, but as newborn screening programs begin to adopt NGS technologies more broadly, additional resources will be made available.
