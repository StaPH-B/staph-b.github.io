[NCBI Pathogen Detection Pipeline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/) - NCBI Pathogen Detection integrates bacterial pathogen genomic sequences originating in food, environmental sources, and patients. It quickly clusters and identifies related sequences to uncover potential food contamination sources, helping public health scientists investigate foodborne disease outbreaks.
