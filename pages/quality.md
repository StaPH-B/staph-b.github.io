## Welcome to the Quality Page

This page will serve as the starting point for all resources related to quality that may be of interest to public health scientists working in bioinformatics and NGS.  Currently, our main emphasis is for infectious disease applications, but as newborn screening programs begin to adopt NGS technologies more broadly, additional resources will be made available.

### Datasets for Bioinformatics Validation

[GMI (Global Microbial Identifier) Datasets](https://github.com/globalmicrobialidentifier-WG3/datasets/tree/master/datasets) - github respository of datasets for outbreak detection.  Contains the same information as the WGS Benchmark Datasets repository below with one additional _Escherichia coli_ dataset.

[WGS Benchmark Datasets](https://github.com/WGS-standards-and-analysis) - github repository of benchmark datasets. Empirical and simulated datasets for outbreak detection of Campylobacter jejuni, E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica.
