In this webinar, Danny Park, group lead of the viral computational genomics at the Broad Institute and technical consultant for the North East Bioinformatics Regional Resource, spoke about scientific compute workflow management. He provided an overview of WDL and Cromwell and how the Broad Institute and many other genomics institutions are taking advantage of these systems to improve scalability (cloud, cluster, single machine), portability between institutions, and reproducibility.
