In this webinar, Robert Petit and Tim Read from Emory University present on Bactopia, "an extensive workflow for processing Illumina sequencing of bacterial genomes. The goal of Bactopia is to process your data with a broad set of tools, so that you can get to the fun part of analyses quicker!" Bactopia, built on the Nextflow platform, was designed to provide efficient comparative genomic analysis for any bacterial species or genus. Bactopia can be accessed through GitHub, Docker, Singularity, and Conda.
