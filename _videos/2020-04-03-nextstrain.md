In this webinar, Alli Black, a PhD candidate in the Bedford Laboratory who has been working extensively on the NextStrain platform, spoke with StaPH-B. During this call, Alli provided a brief introduction to NextStrain, a valuable resource for genomic data analysis and visualization, and demoed some of NextStrainâ€™s functionality. Following this, we opened the floor for a Q&A session with Alli. [Slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video_assets/alliblack-staphb-04-03-2020.pdf)
