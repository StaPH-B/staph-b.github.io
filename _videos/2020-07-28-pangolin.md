This call welcomed Aine O'Toole from the Rambaut lab at the Univeristy of Edinburgh in the UK.  She discussed a few different tools she and others have been working on, pangolin, llama, and civet, all aimed at lineage typing the SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating around the UK and abroad. She discussed development, plans going forward, as well as the role they play in the COG-UK consortium.
