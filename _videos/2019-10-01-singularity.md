For this month’s call, we had a second discussion on container platforms: Jake Garfin (Minnesota Department of Health) and Curtis Kapsak (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) presented an overview of the Singularity container system, it’s similarities and differences compared to Docker, and a short usage demonstration. This is particularly helpful for laboratories that are interested in using the StaPH-B Docker Images, but lack root privileges required to run Docker in their compute environments.
