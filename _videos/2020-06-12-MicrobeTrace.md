In this StaPH-B webinar, we invited Ellsworth Campbell to discuss MicrobeTrace, a "web-based tool to visually render networks from surveillance, epi investigations, and genetic analysis" that can be leveraged to support COVID-19 outbreak investigations. Ellsworth presented on the MicrobeTrace platform and provided useful information on how epidemiologists can utilize MicrobeTrace reports and visualizations to inform public health action. Following this, the floor was opened for a Q&A session.
